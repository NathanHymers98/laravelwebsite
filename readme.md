This is an example of work that I did during my education. Since the other repository that I had during University was deleted, I had to make this new one and add all the files back.

What the application is an eCommerce website with a front end that allows the user browse products, create accounts, add products to their cart to checkout or to their wishlist so that they can save them and come back to them later. I used Stripe Online payment demo so that I could have realistic checkout functionality and get some experience with working with online payments whilst working in an offline environment. 

For the backend of the website I made an admin account that allows change to happen to the products in the database, they can update the details of a product which are name, category, description, price and quantity. They can delete them and also create new ones.
